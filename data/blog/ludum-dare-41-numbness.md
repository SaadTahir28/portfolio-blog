# Ludum Dare 41

## What is Ludum Dare?

Ludum Dare is an online event where games are made from scratch on a weekend. A theme is selected from multiple options and you have to use that theme for your game. After the event ends, the results are not announced instantly. People post their games in the community, play each other's games hence increasing Karma points and getting reviewed by them. This way they gain popularity and score in order to get the top places.

## What does the winner get?

There is no prize money and the prize is your game. You get a game made in 3 days for yourself, gaining confidence from the community reviews and polishing it to turn it into a product.

## Did I compete?

Yes I did compete in Ludum Dare 41. Why wouldn’t I? I really like to come up with new ideas and challenge myself to create something new. The event started on Saturday April 21st to Tuesday April 24th, 2018. The theme was Combine 2 Incompatible Genres. Sounds confusing in the start but when you start brainstorming, you start to realize that this theme really brings out creativity. Just imagine a Rhythm Game + Battle Royale, FPS + Dance, Horror + Rhythm, Platformer + FPS. You might be making ideas in your brain right now. There are many possibilities. One person posted an idea generator that randomly picked two genres from the list and combined them. That was fun and I found my idea from it.

## My Idea

The game is a combination of platformer and FPS. You have to save the princess and get her out of the dungeon. Her arms get numb after drinking the potion of life. She quench her thirst after drinking it but the outcome was horrifying. She lost the feelings of her arms. Now she asks for your protection from the creepy monsters of the dungeons and puzzles to solve and get her out of the darkness.

I combined **Platformer + FPS**. Platformer games like Mario where a 2D character moves left/right, can jump and an action button. FPS game is first person shooting where you can see the player’s hands and the camera is on the head.

Ok so how do I combine it? Well, I will map the action button to the mouse. You will control the character with **AD** keys from the keyboard. It can jump with **SPACEBAR**. And you will use the mouse for actions like shooting with a gun. The mouse movement will move the crosshair in the game and you can aim for the things in the environment. **LMB** on the mouse will shoot.

## The Challenge

I know I can make games because I am a developer and it's simple. Then where’s the challenge? Since I was alone on this project and all my friends were busy preparing for the finals, I had to do it alone. From the idea, to storyline, to development, art, sound design and publishing, I had to do it all by myself. So this was my challenge. Make everything yourself even if it’s not spot on, even if you don’t know how to draw or animate or softwares to do. Just do it. If I were to complete this challenge, then I can do anything.

## Story

I had to come up with a story for my game before doing anything. At that time, I was playing horror games so I had to make it horror. Then I added a princess in that. There was some gun shooting involved and the princess is obviously stuck in a dungeon of her castle. There are some potions involved and fire pits, ghosts and dark environments. So I finalized a story.

A princess with a purple frock, pinkish skin and spikey hair. She gets stuck in a dungeon full of darkness. There are fire lights on the walls but the visibility is low. She is scared and we have to save her. She drinks a potion that makes her hands go numb and she can’t use them. You, as an FPS player, have to pick up a gun and help her get out of this dungeon, kill ghosts and solve puzzles. At the end, she is out and everyone is happy.

## Art & Animations

I don’t know how to use photoshop and can use only Microsoft Paint. I needed something a little more advanced than MS Paint. So I used [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/). It is a sprite editor and can make sprite animations. I created my princess from some ideas on Pinterest. I got inspiration from the Hollow Knight game. I had to make her cry because she is scared so I made an animation of her crying all the time with a sobbing sound.

For the gun, I used two sprites and animated them. One where the gun is idle and the other where the gun is shooting. Whenever the player clicks, the sprite is replaced and you feel like it's an animation. A useful trick

## Horror Soundtrack

I used Bosca Ceoil, a tool made by a member in the community to create 8 bit songs. The soundtrack needs to be horror and emotional. At that time, I was watching Dragon Ball Super. There is a Vegeta God transformation when he fights Toppo and remembers his family and friends, he gets angry and a soundtrack comes up. I placed the notes and gave my touch. Came up with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ii-1268-L0) soundtrack. Cool huh? It becomes horror when you slow it down.

## Why Numbness?

I had to come up with the game title. It had to be something that’s the turning point in the game. Players shouldn't be able to judge the game by reading the title but realize it as they play the game. For example the titles like Last of Us tell us that the game will contain a few people remaining in the world. I came up with the name **Numbness**. Why numbness? Why not Princess in Dungeon or Save the princess. Because these are very simple and you can judge from the title what the game is about.

Have you judged it yet? If not then you have to play the game. You will get it in the first 2 mins of the gameplay.
